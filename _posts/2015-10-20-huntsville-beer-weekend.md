In May 2013, Alabama became (in)famous as the last state to legalize homebrewing. The state legalized craft breweries in 2008\. My theory is that all the avid homebrewers decided to go pro rather than spend more time on the wrong side of the law. Those brewers got their revenge by brewing some of the best high-gravity beers in the Southeast. 

Huntsville is not one of the first cities that comes to mind as a beer destination, but it is a worthy one. Of course, a visit to the Rocket City often includes a visit to the [U.S. Space & Rocket Center][0] (and, if you're like me, daydreams that you're a kid again and off to Space Camp). But Huntsville has plenty to offer the weekend beer traveler. 

Huntsville and its environs contain eight breweries, which can be found on tap at several locations in the area. Moreover, beer bars and beer stores are well-run and have a wide range of beers for every palate. At the [Nook Tavern][1], I had a flight (if you can call 3 6-ounce pours a flight) that included Ballast Point Sculpin, St. Bernardus 12, and Evil Twin Justin (a Berlinerweisse). This was assuredly not the most well-selected flight of beers I've ever created, but it illustrates the very diverse tap selection available. 

[Straight to Ale][2] is the city's flagship brewery, boasting a diverse lineup of beers and a large taproom featuring pinball machines and regular concerts. We planned our trip around one of the series of [Folk Mission][3] concerts and found it well worth the low admission price (around $15). As for beer, Straight to Ale has several barrel-aged offerings that are all worth trying, and many are outstanding. Many of the beer names recall the city's space tradition, including Monkeynaut, a nice IPA, and Laika, an outstanding Russian imperial stout named after the famous Russian space dog.

If your weekend plans include beer and brunch, try [Below the Radar Brewhouse][4]. Below the Radar serves a large variety of local and regional craft beer, as well as nationwide favorites. Their Sunday brunch is popular and delicious. After brunch, consider taking a stroll around the [Old Town Historic District][5], which contains historic homes built in several architectural styles, dating from the 1820s through the 1940s. 

If you want to grab some beer to take home, it's worth a short trip out of your way to [Wish You Were Beer][6]. This small but friendly bottle shop is located in Madison, a short drive from Huntsville, and offers a great variety of beer to go, both on tap and in the can or bottle.
