In May 2013, Alabama became (in)famous as the last state to legalize homebrewing. The state legalized craft breweries in 2008\. My theory is that all the avid homebrewers decided to go pro rather than spend more time on the wrong side of the law. Those brewers got their revenge by brewing some of the best high-gravity beers in the Southeast. 

Huntsville is not one of the first cities that comes to mind as a beer destination, but it is a worthy one. The Rocket City and its environs contain eight breweries, which can be found on tap at several locations in the area. Moreover, beer bars and beer stores are well-run and have a wide range of beers for every palate. At the Nook Tavern, I had a flight (if you can call 3 6-ounce pours a flight) that included Ballast Point Sculpin, St. Bernardus 12, and Evil Twin Justin (a Berlinerweisse). This was assuredly not the most well-selected flight of beers I've ever created, but it illustrates the very diverse tap selection available.
