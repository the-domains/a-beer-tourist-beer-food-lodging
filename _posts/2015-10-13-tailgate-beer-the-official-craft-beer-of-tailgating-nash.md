TailGate 

<article style=""><h1>TailGate Beer</h1><img src="http://tailgatebeer.com/images/buttons/TGB_BeerButton_BlacktopBlonde_New.png" /></article>

Located off Charlotte Pike deep in West Nashville, TailGate fills a real gap in the Nashville beer scene. The brewery and sprawling taproom are located in a former lodge hall. As a result, there is plenty of square footage inside and out, ample parking, and an event-friendly atmosphere. TailGate has capitalized on this by offering a wide variety of events, many of them family-friendly. 

TailGate regularly offers 30 beers on draft, including beers from other breweries, most local or regional. The TailGate beers on tap are almost exclusively brewed at their Nashville site on their small system; the three canned beers are brewed off-site. The offerings are usually interesting and experimental, ranging from sour beers to a wide variety of IPAs to variations on their popular peanut butter stout. The brewery also offers a solid food menu including pizzas and paninis. 

In all, TailGate makes a great stop to watch football or for one of their frequent movie nights.
