# Coming Soon - Bearded Iris Brewing 

The long-awaited [Bearded Iris Brewing][0] will open shop in Germantown soon. Since mid-2015, the brewery has been brewing and distributing a limited number of kegs of its delicious IPA, Habit, to a few locations in Nashville. The brewery will be located at 101 Van Buren Street, and we should see more beer from them soon, as the owners just received their final permits.
