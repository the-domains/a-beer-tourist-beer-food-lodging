It's hard to imagine a more tranquil - and surprising - location to drink beer than behind a warehouse in Southern California. I visited Stone's main brewery in mid-March, on a beautiful Friday afternoon, with a handful of other beer drinkers relaxing in the gardens. While the brewery is a bit out-of-the-way, it's an amazing example of the brewery as a destination. 

Beers offered: Approximately 18 taps of Stone beers, ranging from everyday offerings to experimental variants of Ruination to brewery-only beers. The brewery also serves around 18 guest beers on a given day, as well as regular cask beers. As expected, both the Stone taps and guest taps were IPA-heavy. My favorite of the day was Port Hop 15, which is surprisingly similar to some of my favorite New England IPAs.

Food: The food is upscale and priced accordingly. I enjoyed what I ate, the famous duck tacos, but I didn't find this to be a real food destination. The beer is the highlight.

Crowd: Mostly family groups, including children (they have a kids' menu), during my visit. There were singles and couples at the two bars and lounging outside. The retail store was also very busy and is a little undersized for the number of customers dropping by for growler and crowler fills.

Tours: Offered daily. 

Hours: Daily, from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. (The restaurant closes at 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday nights.)

Address: 1999 Citracado Parkway, Escondido, CA 

Phone: 760.294.7866

Recommended for groups, singles, families, and couples. This is a great, family-friendly location that offers a huge outdoor space for exploring or relaxing.
